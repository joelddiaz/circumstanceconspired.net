title: Easily posting your site to S3
---

Copying files one-at-a-time to Amazon S3 doesn't scale so well and it's prone to errors.  Surely there must be a better way, and there is.

<!--more-->

There's a great little tool written in Python named 's3cmd'.  With this you can use the tool to automatically clone any set of files over to Amazon's S3 service.  First thing you need is your Amazon Access Key.

Make your way over to <https://aws.amazon.com>, log in, then click on "My Account/Console" -> "Security Credentials" near the top.

That will take you to a page titled "Your Security Credentials".  If this is your first visit to this, Amazon will recommend that you set up "IAM Users" to manage permissions for your account.  Go ahead and click that "Get Started with IAM Users" button, or click "Users" on the left of the page.

Click the "Create New Users" button and make up a name for the account that will be used to upload to your S3 storage bucket(s).  As an example, I used 'circumstanceconspired_uploader'.  Make sure "Generate an access key for each user" is checked, then hit "Create".

Your new user will be created with an "Access Key Id" and a "Secret Access Key".  Either download or copy the keys as we'll need them in a moment.

Close that window with the credentials and you'll be back to your user list.  Check your new user and at the bottom of the screen, select the "Permissions" tab.

Select the "Attach User Policy" button and scroll down the list of policy templates to "Amazon S3 Full Access".  This should give the user enough permissions to upload and delete files stored on your S3 bucket.

Select "Apply Policy", and your S3 upload user should be ready for use.

Now install the 's3cmd' program (<http://s3tools.org/s3cmd>) with a `yum install s3cmd` (or `apt-get install s3cmd` if Debian is your thing (not that there's anything wrong with that)).

Run `s3cmd --configure` to set up the app.  It will ask you to provide the "Access Key" and "Secret Key" which you saved previously.  Then you set up an encryption password.  I just typed a bunch of gibberish to make a secure-looking password.  Accept the default for the location of GPG.  Answer 'Yes' for the "Use HTTPS protocol" line.  Lastly, hit 'Y' to test the connection.  Assuming everything looks good, 'Y' to save your settings.

To actually have 's3cmd' sync your site over to your Amazon S3, you should run `s3cmd sync ./_site/ s3://[your S3 bucket name here]` from the root of your jekyll site (the directory that holds the '_site' directory that jekyll dumps everything into).  A successfull sync should look something like this:

    [joel@10-0-11-216 circumstanceconspired.net]$ pwd
    /home/joel/circumstanceconspired.net
    [joel@10-0-11-216 circumstanceconspired.net]$ s3cmd sync ./_site/ s3://circumstanceconspired.net
    ./_site/2013/06/14/s3cmd.html -> s3://circumstanceconspired.net/2013/06/14/s3cmd.html  [1 of 4]

    ./_site/img/2013-06-14-security-credentials.png -> s3://circumstanceconspired.net/img/2013-06-14-security-credentials.png  [3 of 4]

    ./_site/index.html -> s3://circumstanceconspired.net/index.html  [4 of 4]
     2761 of 2761   100% in    0s    12.22 kB/s  done
    Done. Uploaded 24343 bytes in 1.3 seconds, 18.82 kB/s

The 's3cmd sync' command is smart enough to not re-upload files that are already stored in your S3 bucket, so uploading a new post should involve nothing more than updating the main site page (index.html), the actual post and any new images/content associated with the new post.

The last thing to do is to create a shell script in the root of your jekyll site so that you don't have to remember the 's3cmd' command.  Since jekyll will ignore any fies that start with an '_' when generating your site, make sure the script name starts with an '_' so that jekyll leaves your S3 syncing script off of your website (not that it would really harm anything if it did copy it over).  My '_deploy_to_s3.sh' looks like:

    #!/bin/bash

    s3cmd sync ./_site/ s3://circumstanceconspired.net

Make the file executable (`chmod +x _deploy_to_s3.sh`) and in the future you can just run `./_deploy_to_s3.sh` whenever you're ready to have the contents of '_site' mirrored over to your S3 bucket.
