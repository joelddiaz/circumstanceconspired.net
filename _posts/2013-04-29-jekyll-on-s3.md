title: Using jekyll to build your site
---

Now that we have a site hosted with Amazon S3, we will look into using jekyll to manage and automate the creation of a static website.
<!--more-->

First, why would you want to use one of these static site generating tools in the first place? Something like Wordpress is undoubtedly great, but there is a lot of technology in a Wordpress-enabled site.  This exposes you to the occasional security vulnerability. For my needs Wordpress is overkill, so something more simple could servce my needs just as well. Static html sites should serve my needs just fine, and Amazon S3 pricing is - shall we say - economical.

Going with static sites can simplify things, but if you're not careful you are going to be editing a lot of raw html files. If, for example, you decide that you want to change the title and/or insert a new image at the top of every page, you may end up having to edit every single html file to take your change. Not that some fancy sed scripting couldn't accomplish this, but surely there must be a better way.

Using a site-generating tool will allow you to define templates that get applied to your pages when they are generated. You update the template with the changes you need and regenerate your site in one command.

A Google search will show that ![jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) seems to be the tool all the cool kids are using to create static web sites hosted on github. Since I don't know any better, I went with jekyll.

Installing is a simple matter of making sure you have the ruby and ruby-devel package (at least that's what the packages are named in Fedora). `yum install ruby ruby-devel` takes care of this.

Now (not necessarily as root), run `gem install jekyll` and you're done.

As a simple examplei, create a directory and put the following index.html file into the otherwise empty directory:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <main>
    <title>1st page</title>
    </main>
    <body>
    test page
    </body>
    </html>

Now run `jekyll`. You'll see some messages displayed, but you should be able to ignore them for now. Look at your directory, and you'll see a new '_site' directory. This is where the staticaly generated site will be created when you call `jekyll`. Having it just copy files from one place to the next isn't very helpful, so we'll start by creating some layouts to use for our pages.

Create a '_layout' directory and a file named 'default.html' with the contents:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
      <title> {{"{% if page.title "}}%} {{"{{ page.title "}}}} {{"{% else "}}%} No title! {{"{% endif "}}%} </title>
    </head>
    <body>
     <header>
      My jekyll website
     </header>

    {{"{{ content "}}}}

     <footer>
      &copy; John Doe {{"{% if page.custom_year "}}%} {{"{{ page.custom_year "}}}} {{"{% else "}}%} 2013 {{"{% endif "}}%}
     </footer>
    </body>
    </html>

This layout will set the title based on the existence of the variable page.title or set it to 'No title!' if it's undefined. It also includes a `<header>` section followed by the actual specific page content (which we haven't yet created) that gets filled into the '{{ content }}' area. Lastly, there is a `<footer>` tag with the copyright year set based on whether the variable 'page.custom_year' contains info. Otherwise, it's just set to '2013'.

Now we need a page to run through this layout. Change your main 'index.html' at the root of your site's directory and have it contain:

    ---
    layout: default
    ---
    <section class="content">
     Content of main page.
    </section>

The section surrounded by the three dashes is where jekyll will figure out what to do with the file. In this case it tells jekyll to run the file through the 'default' layout.

Now running `jekyll` will again produce an 'index.html' file again. But you can see it has been run through the layout and produced a new file. Go ahead an open up '_site/index.html' and it should look like:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
      <title>  No title!  </title>
    </head>
    <body>
     <header>
      My jekyll website
     </header>

    <section class="content">
     Content of main page.
    </section>


     <footer>
      &copy; John Doe  2013
     </footer>
    </body>
    </html>

You can see that the resulting file has been produced by inserting the content of your root 'index.html' file placed into the '\{\{ content \}\}' part in the '_layout/default.html' file.

Now try changing the `<footer>` output by setting 'custom_year' to '2000' in your main 'index.html' file so that it looks like:

    ---
    layout: default
    custom_year: 2000
    ---
    <section class="content">
     Content of main page.
    </section>

Re-run `jekyll` and you should get a page with the following `<footer>` in '_site/index.html':

     <footer>
      &copy; John Doe  2000
     </footer>

Opening the generated html files in a text editor is fine for these simple pages, but you can have jekyll start up a web server to serve up your site by running `jekyll --server`. Now point your favorite browser to <http://localhost:4000> and view your site.

Last thing is how to have jekyll handle your other non html content. The trick here is that jekyll will copy any files over to the '_site' destination as long as the files don't start with '_'. So you can post an image by making and 'img' directory with the content in there, and jekyll will copy it exactly as you set it up into '_site/img'.

Go ahead and put an image (I named mine 'pic_example.jpg') under your 'img' directory. Run `jekyll` and see that your '_site' directory now should now contain your new 'img' directory and the file you placed into it.

    _site/
    _site/img
    _site/img/pic-example.jpg
    _site/index.html

Now you can use the content by incorporating it into '_layouts/default.html'.

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
      <title> {{"{% if page.title "}}%} {{"{{ page.title "}}}} {{"{% else "}}%} No title! {{"{% endif "}}%} </title>
    </head>
    <body>
     <header>
      My jekyll website
     </header>

     <img src="/img/pic-example.jpg"/>
    {{"{{ content "}}}}

     <footer>
      &copy; John Doe {{"{% if page.custom_year "}}%} {{"{{ page.custom_year" "}}}} {{"{% else "}}%} 2013 {{"{% endif "}}%}
     </footer>
    </body>
    </html>

You can of course do more than just have jekyll copy over images. Your stylesheets should be done in the same way.
